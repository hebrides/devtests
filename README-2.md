## SMG Dev Test #2 - Quote of the Day

### Develop a web application that delivers a daily inspiring quote

#### Performance Goals

1) Index page displays a new quote every day (default behavior), or, optionally, via a setting, a random quote. The app "remembers" this setting.
2) Quote data object includes useful metadata, including, but not limited to, _Language, Author, Writer, Character, Speaker, Chapter, Verse, Act, Line, Scene, Title,_ and _Book_.

#### Bonuses

After you have a simple working solution, add as many of the following features as possible:

- Display an attractive background image with the quote using a random image service (e.g., Pexels, Unsplash).
- Write meta tags for SEO and the Open Graph Protocol (<http://ogp.me/>) 
- Host your app on a free service like Netlify, Serverless.com, Heroku, or AWS
- Route to your app from a subdomain of a [FQDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) that you control with SSL, e.g.: `https://qod.jodiethecodeninja.io/`
- Create a UI for a password secured admin to CRUD new quotes and validate new quote data for security
- Create features for the admin to organize quotes by metadata (e.g., Author, Book, Scene, etc.)
- Create a feature for the user to search through your quotes

#### Appearance

- Use a simple, attractive design and logo: <https://logomaster.ai>
- Use an Open Source Font from a CDN: <https://github.com/alfredxing/brick/wiki/Usage>
- Use a popular CSS framework: BlueprintJS, Bootstrap, Material, Evergreen, Bulma, etc.

#### Code Details

- Code should be commented and easy to read
- Store your work on Github or Gitlab
- Be prepared to explain your logic
- Avoid copy / paste solutions, but feel free to use libraries and functions from web resources, as long as you can explain how these work

#### Time Limit

- 4 hrs

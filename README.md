# SMG Mobile Developer Tests

Solve these tests to demonstrate your software development skills.

## SMG Dev Test #1 - Tiny URI Image

### Develop a web application that creates a tiny uri for an uploaded image

#### Performance Goals

1) Use unreserved alphanumberic characters for the shortened URI (e.g., `https://myapp.io/A18fhsH3`).

2) Focus on solving the core problem efficiently.

#### Bonuses

After you have a simple working solution, add as many of the following features as possible:

- Limit upload size to 10MB and validate file type on the frontend
- Validate contraints for size and type on the backend
- Write meta tags for SEO and the Open Graph Protocol (<http://ogp.me/>) 
- Host the image path on a CDN like S3 or store its data in local database like MySQL or Mongo as a blog, or in a remote database / service like Firebase or Parse
- Offer to compress the image client side prior to upload
- Use a Presigned URL to upload directly from your client to cloud storage
- Host your app on a free service like Netlify, Serverless.com, Heroku, or AWS
- Run a server side binary / lambda funtion, or use a Cloud Service API to further optimize the image with minimal reduction in quality, maximal reduction in size
- Route to your app from a subdomain of a [FQDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) that you control with SSL, e.g.: `https://img2url.jodiethecodeninja.io/`
- Accept more interesting MIME types like `image/heic`, `image/svg`, and `application/pdf`
- Accept proprietary visual formats like `.fig` and `.sketch`

#### Appearance

- Use a simple, attractive design and logo: <https://logomaster.ai>
- Use a Google Font: <https://fonts.google.com>
- Use a popular CSS framework: BlueprintJS, Bootstrap, Material, Evergreen, Bulma, etc.

#### Code Details

- Code should be commented and easy to read
- Store your work on Github or Gitlab
- Be prepared to explain your logic
- Avoid copy / paste solutions, but feel free to use libraries and functions from web resources, as long as you can explain how these work

#### Time Limit

- 4 hrs
